# Parametricity for System F Omega in Coq
Here are some references I used for this development:
- [A short and flexible proof of strong normalization for the calculus of constructions](https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/2181809/9511424.pdf)
- [Coq in Coq](https://github.com/coq-contribs/coq-in-coq)
- [POPLmark Reloaded](https://poplmark-reloaded.github.io)
- [Reynolds's Parametricity Theorem, Directly](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/courses/chtt/pdfs/reynolds.pdf)

# Structure of the development
The Coq files are stored under the [theories](theories) directory.

The [Autosubst2](theories/Autosubst2) directory contains the syntax files generated by the autosubst tool. The syntax specification can be found in [syntax.sig](syntax.sig). Autosubst generates the substitution functions and tactics for proving equalities about substitutions.

[par.v](theories/par.v) contains the reduction relations for types and terms. It also includes an inductive characterization of strongly normalizing (and neutral) terms.

[typing.v](theories/typing.v) contains the typing judgments of the language, including type well-formedness (`TyWt`) and term well-typedness (`Wt`).

[semantics.v](theories/semantics.v) contains the semantic interpretations for kinds (`int_kind`) and types (`int_type`). The fundamental theorem is named `soundness`.
